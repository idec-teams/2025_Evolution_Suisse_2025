# Lab notebooks

## February - March

+ Project selection
+ Scientific discussuions
+ Initial planning


## April 

+ Lab selection
+ Cloning scheme design
+ Ordering of the compounds, oligos, PCR primers and other DNA fragments

## May

+ Introduction to the lab
+ PCR amplification of required fragments
+ Cloning of the level 0 plasmids
+ Editing of the backbones available in the lab (e.g.inversions)
+ Target selection

## June

+ Cloning most level 1 plasmids
+ Cloning optimisation for golden gate
+ Creation of promoter and RBS libraries for the genes required for the plasmid based EcORep system
+ Design of the fluorescence based bridge recombinase efficiency assay
+ Design of the DML library of IS622 variants

## July

+ Deletion of the csg operon in Marionette-Clo _E. Coli_ strain to obtain SEM6 _E.Coli_, a strain that will be used for further transformations in course of the project
+ Fluorescence based efficiency assay (GFP-mScarlet inversion, GFP insertion) to determine the initial efficiency of bridge recombinases towards selected target and donor sequences 

## August

+ DML variant preparation
+ Illumina sequencing
+ Preliminary design of the selection plasmid antibiotic-based functionality assay 
+ Phage cloning

## September

+ Plating assay to determine the functionality of the designed selection plasmid  
+ Report preparation
+ Phage propagation assay

## October

+ Presentation preparation
+ Team Wiki creation
+ Poster design
