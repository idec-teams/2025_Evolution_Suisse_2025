# Lab notebooks

## February - March

+ Project selection
+ Scientific discussuions
+ Initial planning


## April 

+ Lab selection
+ Cloning scheme design
+ Ordering of the compounds, oligos, PCR primers, Twist fragments

## May

+ Introduction to the lab
+ PCR amplification of required fragments
+ Cloning of the level 0 plasmids
+ Editing of the backbones available in the lab (e.g.inversions)
+ Target selection

## June

+ Cloning most level 1 plasmids: bRNA, targets etc

## July

+ Introducing deletion into Marionette-Clo _E. Coli_ strain to obtain SEM6 _E.Coli_, a strain that will be used for further transformations in course of the project
+ Fluorescence based efficiency assay (GFP-mScarlet inversion) to determine the initial efficiency of bridge recombinases towards selected target and donor sequences 

## August

+ DML variant preparation
+ Illumina sequencing
+ 

## September

+ Plating assay to determine the functionality of the designed selection plasmid  
+ Report preparation

## October
