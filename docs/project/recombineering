The strain was generated using lambda red recombineering using pSIJ8 [^jensen_1] to delete the csg operon from Marionette-Clo (sAJM.1504) [^meyer_2]. The csg operon was deleted to prevent biofilm formation [^yan_3]. The deletion was done using lambda red recombineering as described here [^jensen_1]. Fresh cultures of Marionette-Clo were grown to an OD600 of 0.3 and then induced with 15 mM L-arabinose (final concentration) for an hour. Subsequently the cells were made electrocompetent. The linear dsDNA (see Table 2) was electroporated in to the cells. Then they were recovered and plated. Six colonies were picked the following day and liquid cultures were set up. Finally the fliptase was induced in theese liquid cultures with 50 mM L-rhamnose (final concentration) and grown at 38°C to cure pSIJ8. The deletion was validated using colony PCR . The cultures from the single colonies are designated S1-S6 (see Figure 13).

The plasmids with inducible promoters were transformed into sEM6 (Further details can be found in section 5.1.1.).

To prepare the electrocompetent cells, 100 µL of the overnight cultures of sEM 6 E. coli were subcultured into 10 ml of LB media (initial OD of tilde 0.05) and grown at 37 °C, 250 rpm. until the OD600=0.3 was reached. Cultures were induced with 15 mM L-arabinose for 45 min and later centrifuged (4,400xg, 4 °C, 5 min). Cells were washed 4 times by resuspending the pellets in 10 ml of 10% glycerol in deionised water and centrifugation (6,000xg, 4 °C, 3.5 min) and pellets were resuspended in 2 ml 10% glycerol. After the washing, pellets were resuspended in 5 mL of 10% glycerol and stored at −80 ◦C until use.

The heat-shock competent sEM6 cells were prepared in-house with Mix ’n Go kit (Zymo Research, USA).

pES013.2 and pES055.2 were co-transformed into E. coli sEM6 strain, spread onto LB agar containing appropriate antibiotics and incubated overnight at 37°C.

Next, we transformed E. coli Marionette-Clo and sEM6 strains with pES071.2, scraped and cultured the bacteria (Figure 11F).

Electrocompetent E. coli DH10B Marionette-Clo and sEM6 cells were thawed on ice, 5 µl of the Golden Gate Assembly was mixed with 100 µl of each cell strain and incubated for one minute.
