Technologies such as CRISPR or base editors can change individual DNA letters with remarkable precision, but they are not well suited for inserting or replacing long DNA fragments such as full-length genes. These methods often depend on creating double-stranded DNA breaks and letting the cell repair them, which can lead to unwanted mutations, low efficiency in certain cell types, or even larger genomic rearrangements <sup>2</sup>.  </p> <p>Many genetic diseases, including those affecting only a few thousand patients, are caused by a large number of different mutations within the same gene. Developing a specific therapy for each individual variant is costly and time-consuming. To make genetic medicine more accessible, we need tools that can insert an intact gene copy into its natural genomic position, regardless of the underlying mutation <sup>3</sup>.  </p>"},{"location":"#our-approach","title":"Our Approach","text":"<p>Our project focuses on a new class of genome editing enzymes called bridge recombinases. These enzymes combine a recombinase protein with an RNA molecule called a bridge RNA (bRNA) that guides the recombination process. The bridge RNA can bind to both the genomic target site and a donor DNA fragment. By doing so, it brings the two DNA pieces close together and allows the recombinase to join them precisely <sup>4</sup>.  </p> <p>Bridge recombinases share important features with CRISPR systems, as both use RNA to recognize specific DNA sequences. The key difference is in what happens afterward. CRISPR makes a cut in the DNA, and the cell has to repair it, whereas bridge recombinases perform a clean exchange without breaking both DNA strands. This has the potential to make the process safer and allows for the precise insertion of much larger DNA fragments<sup>2</sup> <sup>4</sup>.  </p> <p>To further improve these enzymes, we apply directed evolution, a laboratory process that mimics natural selection. Through this approach, we aim to evolve bridge recombinases that are faster, more accurate, and suitable for therapeutic use. Our proof of concept focuses on Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (A1ATD), a genetic liver and lung disease caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene <sup>5</sup>. The ultimate goal is to insert a healthy copy of this gene directly into its natural genomic position in human cells, offering a universal treatment that works for all patients, no matter which mutation they have.  </p>"},{"location":"#workflow","title":"Workflow","text":"<p>The first step in our workflow was the identification of suitable target sites in the SERPINA1 gene. We selected several positions that are highly conserved across patients and located them upstream of most known pathogenic mutations, ensuring that insertion of a healthy gene copy would restore function for all variants.  </p> <p>Next, we developed a computational screening method called deep mutational learning (DML) <sup>6</sup>. This method allowed us to explore thousands of possible sequence variations in the recombinase and identify promising candidates with improved activity using machine-learning. DML helped us understand the enzyme\u2019s fitness landscape and choose the best starting points for experimental evolution.   </p> <p>For laboratory evolution, we developed two directed evolution logics. The first, called E.coli Orthognoal Replicon (EcORep) <sup>7</sup>, uses a special DNA replicon inside E. coli that mutates at a high rate. Variants with higher recombination activity can be enriched over time, allowing the enzyme to evolve continuously toward better performance. The second system, Phage-assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) <sup>8</sup>, uses bacteriophages whose ability to reproduce depends on successful recombination. Only phages carrying active or improved recombinases can propagate, linking enzyme function directly to viral survival.  </p>"},{"location":"#key-achievements","title":"Key Achievements","text":"<ul> <li> <p>We identified functional target sequences within the SERPINA1 gene that can be recognized by both IS621 and IS622 bridge recombinases, providing a foundation for precise insertion of a healthy gene copy.  </p> </li> <li> <p>We designed and implemented a sequencing-based assay to screen bridge recombinase variants and successfully assembled a mutational library that covers a broad distribution of sequence diversity, enabling deep mutational learning and identification of improved enzyme variants.  </p> </li> <li> <p>We established an evolutionary selection logic using the EcORep system <sup>7</sup>, allowing continuous mutagenesis and enrichment of more active recombinase variants, and validated the system experimentally through successful DNA cassette flipping in E. coli.  </p> </li> <li> <p>We developed and optimized a phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) framework <sup>8</sup> for bridge recombinases, confirming the feasibility of linking recombinase activity to phage propagation and establishing the groundwork for continuous evolution of high-performance variants.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#references","title":"References:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Li T, Yang Y, Qi H, Cui W, Zhang L, Fu X, He X, Liu M, Li P, Yu T.

In our system (see Figure1), the selection phage (SP) carries the evolving ISCro4 recombinase but does not contain gIII; as a consequence, SPs cannot replicate unless gIII is provided in trans by the host. To couple gIII expression tightly to successful recombination, the accessory plasmid (AP) carried by the host encodes gIII (and a luciferase reporter) without a promoter, and places the appropriate recombination target sequence upstream of these genes. A separate complementary plasmid (CP) encodes the bRNA and the donor sequence, and includes a promoter upstream of the donor. The intended recombination event moves that promoter into the correct position in front of gIII (and luciferase, when present). Thus, without recombination, there is no gIII expression and the SP cannot propagate; with successful recombination, the promoter is repositioned to drive pIII production, enabling replication of SPs that encode functional (and ideally improved) ISCro4 variants. In continuous culture, this design should favour variants that recombine efficiently at the programmed site, because only those variants gain access to pIII and can outcompete the dilution imposed by the lagoon flow.</p> <p></p> Figure 1: Overview of phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) for bridge recombinase ISCro4: Selection phage (SP) carries the evolving ISCro4 recombinase but lacks  gIII , which encodes the essential coat protein pIII. The host  E. coli  harbours three plasmids: (i) an accessory plasmid (AP) containing the target site plus  gIII  and a luciferase reporter that are promoterless; (ii) a complementary plasmid (CP) containing the bRNA and a strong promotor with the donor sequence downstream; and (iii) a mutagenesis plasmid (MP). Upon successful insertion, the CP promoter is positioned immediately upstream of  gIII  (and luciferase), which drives pIII expression and enables replication of SPs encoding active recombinase variants. PACE is conducted in a fixed-volume \u201clagoon\u201d with continuous dilution by fresh host cells, so only SPs that replicate faster than the dilution rate persist and evolve; ongoing mutation from the MP diversifies progeny for subsequent rounds of selection.  <p>Although ISCro4 is highly active in human cells, its activity in E. coli has not been documented. To test whether ISCro4 can catalyse promoter-repositioning insertions (modelling the insertion needed to restore a healthy SERPINA1 copy) in bacteria when paired with designed bRNAs, we constructed an sfGFP reporter that mirrors the PACE selection logic (Figure2A). In this system, sfGFP is carried on a low-copy plasmid with the recombination target site (either ISCro4 WT target, SERPINA1 target 1-3 or ISCro4 WT donor sequence)  upstream and no promoter - analogous to gIII on the AP - and is co-transformed with a CP encoding the bRNA and a promoter\u2013donor cassette, together with an arabinose-inducible ISCro4 expression plasmid. </p> <p></p>  Figure 2: sfGFP activity assay for ISCro4 in   E. coli  . A Schematic of sfGPF activity assay. A low-copy plasmid carries sfGFP with its target site upstream and no promoter (AP-analog). The high-copy CP encodes the bRNA and a promoter\u2013donor cassette. ISCro4 is expressed from an arabinose-inducible plasmid. Recombination repositions the CP promoter directly upstream of sfGFP, leading to sfGFP expression.   B Flow-cytometry readout after ~ 20 h post arabinose induction at 37\u00b0C showing %GFP-positive cells.  <p>We observed that wild-type ISCro4 catalyses insertion in E. coli in a recombinase- and bRNA-dependent manner: sfGFP activation was not detected with catalytically dead ISCro4 or with non-targeting bRNA controls. Moreover, bRNA reprogrammed to SERPINA target 1 exhibits activity above the wild-type target after 20 h after arabinose induction. While the precise percentage of GFP-positive cells depends on construct and growth conditions, these results establish that (i) ISCro4 is active in E. coli and (ii) activity can be redirected by designed bRNAs to non-native targets. Together, the sfGFP data support the feasibility of using the same promoter-repositioning logic to control gIII during selection. Although ISCro4 catalyses the intended donor\u2013target insertion, prior work has also reported donor\u2013donor recombination, a major potential source of off-target events <sup>2</sup>. To directly assess donor\u2013donor activity, we modified the AP by replacing the upstream target site with a copy of the donor sequence. In line with the previously published data <sup>2</sup>, ISCro4 exhibited donor-donor recombination.</p> <p>To quantify the transcriptional gain produced by promoter repositioning and to validate that the post-recombination state strongly expresses gIII, we designed a mock-integrated plasmid that mimics the recombination product: the promoter is pre-installed upstream of gIII. On the same transcript downstream of gIII, a luciferase is expressed to enable a luminescent readout proportional to transcription through the gIII\u2013lux cassette. When comparing strains carrying the pre-recombination configuration versus the mock-integrated (post-recombination) construct, we observed a ~10,000-fold (four-orders-of-magnitude) increase in luminescence for the mock-integrated state (Figure3), indicating a working transcription unit upon site-specific insertion.</p> <p></p>  Figure 3: Validation of promoter repositioning. The mock inserted plasmid mimics the post-recombination product which leads to constitutive  gIII   expression. Additionally, a luciferase gene placed downstream on the same transcript provides a luminescent readout proportional to transcription to  gIII  . Comparing the pre-recombination state and the mock inserted states reveals a 10'000-fold luminescence increase in the mock-integrated condition, confirming strong  gIII   transcription upon promoter repositioning in  E. coli   after 16-18 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C. <p>Having established activity and a transcriptional readout, we next asked whether the full selection logic supports phage propagation. We infected E. coli carrying the AP and CP with the ISCro4 selection phage (SP\u2013ISCro4) and incubated cultures overnight (Figure4A). As an initial test, we used WT ISCro4 with its cognate bRNA and quantified titres the following day. Under these conditions, no significant titre increase was observed relative to input phage titre and negative controls (non-targeting bRNA) (Figure4B). Nonetheless, junction-specific PCR spanning the donor\u2013target recombination site yielded the expected product, confirming that recombination occurred despite the lack of phage amplification (Figure4C).</p> <p></p>  Figure 4: Overnight phage propagation assay with WT ISCro4. A Setup: SP\u2013ISCro4 (no  gIII  ) infects hosts bearing AP (promoterless  gIII   + target) and CP (bRNA + promoter\u2013donor); recombination should reposition the promoter to drive  gIII  .   B Result: After overnight infection with SP\u2013ISCro4, phage titers show no significant increase versus input phage titer and non-targeting bRNA negative controls; likewise for the unspecific selection phage expressing rpoZ. Positive control showes that SP\u2013ISCro4 is capable of propagation when supplied with pIII in trans.

Two factors likely explain this: (i) host burden from AP+CP plus ISCro4 expression and the recombination process itself, which can slow growth, impair F-pilus biogenesis, and limit phage production/release; and (ii) kinetics: the rates of recombination of WT ISCro4 and subsequent pIII accumulation may be too slow to support measurable propagation.</p> <p>To overcome the barrier of low rate of recombination with WT ISCro4, we will begin with neutral drift of the selection phage and phage-assisted non-continuous evolution (PANCE) under permissive conditions to accumulate diversity.

In CRISPR, this is the guide RNA (gRNA), which directs Cas9 to make a precise cut in the DNA.

All components necessary for selection are contained on a single \u201dselection plasmid\u201d while the bridge recombinase is located on a different plasmid or orthogonal replicon. This system is adaptable to several continuous DE methods such as MutaT7 <sup>1</sup>, T7-ORACLE<sup>2</sup> and E. coli orthogonal replication system (EcORep) <sup>3</sup>. Selection of variants with higher activity occurs as follows: the selection plasmid carries two bRNAs under the control of inducible promoters (Figure 1 A) and a cassette encoding two antibiotic resistance genes facing in opposite directions. This cassette can be inverted via bRNA-mediated recombination. Only one of the resistance genes is expressed in each of the orientations of the cassette. Therefore, it is possible to select for successful inversion of the cassette using antibiotics (Figure 1 B). This allows for the enrichment of recombinase variants with increased activity over time. Expression of bRNA A can be induced by the addition of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) and results in inversion of the cassette from its initial orientation (gentamycin (Gm) \u2192kanamycin (Kan)). Expression of bRNA B is induced using N-(3-Hydroxytetradecanoyl)-DL-homoserine lactone (OHC14) and mediates the reverse process (Kan \u2192Gm)</p> <p> </p>  Figure 1: DE of IS621 using EcORep.

The O-Replicon carries IS621 under the control of the inducible PVanCC promoter. The selection plasmid contains a casette with two antibiotic resistances, Gm resistance (GmR) and Kan resistance (KanR) facing in opposite directions. Depending on the orientation of the cassette, either GmR or KanR is transcribed. The cassette is flanked by donor and target sequences facing each other. This allows for IS621 + bRNA mediated inversion. B depicts the selection process. Cells are grown in LB liquid culture. IS621 expression is induced using vanillic acid (Van). Shortly before stationary phase, bRNA expression is induced by addition of aTc for bRNA A or OHC14 for bRNA B. Presence of IS621 + bRNA promotes recombination. Selection is performed by regrowing cells in media containing Kan or Gm. Cells that have successfully recombined express the correct AB resistance and survive, cells that did not recombine die. This process promotes the survival of bacteria carrying more active IS621 variants.  <p>EcORep is a continuous DE method that allows DE of large DNA segments in E. coli. EcORep uses genes from PRD1 phage to replicate a linear orthogonal replicon (O-Replicon) with an increased mutation rate<sup>3</sup>. We attempted to adapt EcORep and use it for the evolution of IS621. IS621 is encoded on the O-replicon, which allows the generation of many variants in continuous culture. Expression of IS621 is controlled by the inducible PVanCC promoter. Cells that carry more active variants of IS621 are more likely to recombine during the time interval between bRNA induction and antibiotic (AB) addition. This results in enrichment of bacteria carrying more active recombinase variants.

These are flanked by donor and target sequences to allow for IS621 + bRNA mediated flipping. pES055.2 contains IS621 followed by mTagBFP2 to facilitate the gating of cells bearing both plasmids. Induction with aTc leads to expression of the bRNA and therefore recombination. B Percentage of mScarlet3-positive cells over the number of cells expressing both IS621 recombinase and the fluorescent reporter plasmid. Marionette-Clo cells carrying plasmids pES049.2 and pES055.2 were either uninduced (blue) or induced (green) with 200 nM aTc for the indicated times before the analysis. Bars indicate mean values of three replicates, with individual data points shown. Each panel represents a different target sequence (1, 2 or 3).

We co-transformed the selection plasmid (pES013.2A) with a plasmid constitutively expressing IS621 (pES055.2). In this simplified model system, inversion is induced by the addition of aTc leading to the expression of the bRNA A. We first showed that the bacterial population maintains the selection plasmid in the absence of antibiotic selection by Gm or Kan in liquid culture over the course of 15 h (Figure 3 A). Based on this, we devised the induction scheme showed in Figure 3 C.</p> <p>The bacterial population was induced in late exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub>O=0.6). We tested two different conditions: </p> <ol> <li> <p>No antibiotic after induction</p> </li> <li> <p>Kanamycin added after aTc induction to select for succesful inversions of the antibiotic cassette. </p> </li> </ol> <p>For each condition, controls in which bRNA expression was not induced were included.  Bacteria were grown for 15 hours after induction and then, those grown in absence of Kan were diluted into fresh media and grown for an additional 15 hours. This allowed for a longer induction period while minimizing cell death.  Notably, some bacterial colonies were already able to grow on Kan plates before induction (t=0), indicating a low level of pre-existing resistance in the native population (Figure 3 D (i)).</p> <p> </p>  Figure 3: Phenotypic selection for successful inversion by IS621 following induction of bRNA expression with aTc.

Cultures grown with Kan were terminated after 15 h, (iii) induced samples grown in abscence of Kan for 30 h plated as droplets in duplicate. Black markings on plates indicate the position of bacterial droplet when plated.  <p>Following this assay monoclonal cultures were grown and their DNA sequenced. While the sequencing data confirmed inversion of the AB cassette, it also detected escape mutations, in some of the colonies grown in the presence of Kan. Two escape mutations were identified: large deletions as well as insertions of genomic host DNA.  Upon deletion KanR gene was placed under the control of the pTet promoter, which otherwise controls bRNA A expression, enabling cell surivival without inversion of the cassette (Figure 4 A).  The second escape mutation we observed was a partial insertion of the transposable element IS150 from IS3 family <sup>7</sup>. This fragment contains a promoter which leads to the expression of KanR and cell survival (Figure 4 B).</p> <p> </p>  Figure 4: Schematic of escape mutants. In the unmodified selection plasmid, the resistance cassette is under the control of only one promoter. Gene deletion A, off-target recombination or insertion of an exogenous gene sequence B may lead to re-localization of a second promoter downstream of the cassette. This can lead to the formation of escape mutants. Escape mutants express GmR and KanR simultaneously and thus no longer need to flip the cassette for survival during selection. During our selection experiments we found two escape mutants. One showed a large deletion. Both bRNAs where absent from the plasmid and the KanR gene was under the control of the PTet promoter. The the other escape mutants carried a fragment of IS150. The IS150 fragment contains an additional promoter and supports KanR expression.  <p>These escape mutations represent a limit for the applicability of our system, as they allow cells to grow without the need for IS621-catalysed recombination. To counteract this, we have devised an experimental strategy which aims to reduce the number of possible escape mutations. Escape mutants as shown if Figure 4 appear when a promoter is re-localized and the simultaneous transcription of GmR and KanR are enabled. This renders inversion of the AB cassette unnecessary. The incorporation of CcdA/CcdB toxin/antitoxin system into the selection plasmid as shown in Figure 5 should greatly reduce the number of escape mutants. The toxin CcdB inhibits DNA gyrase, an essential enzyme that can introduce negative supercoils in the DNA during replication. Loss of gyrase activity results in cell death. The antitoxin CcdA binds CcdB and neutralizes the toxic effects. <sup>8</sup> In our proposed system, both CcdA and CcdB are constitutively expressed. CcdA is located downstream of the AB cassette. Transcription of CcdA is initiated form one of two promoters within the AB cassette, depending on the orientation of the cassette. Insertion, deletion or off target recombination events that can lead to the formation of escape mutants in the previous system (pES013.2). In the ajdusted system, such events should result in the loss of CcdA transcription, which leads to cell death. </p> <p> </p>  Figure 5: Introduction of the CcdA/CcdB toxin/antitoxin system in the selection plasmid to reduce the number of possible escape mutants. A Native configuration of the selection plasmid with the integrated CcdA/CcDB toxin/antitoxin system. Expression of CcdA suppresses CcdB toxicity. B Relocalization of the second promoter downstream of the cassette leads to loss of CcdA expression and cell death.  <p>As a next step we aim to demonstrate inversion in the reverse direction (Kan --&gt; Gm) following induction of the bRNA. Successful implementation of this step would enable continuous directed evolution. This could involve growing the bacteria in a continuous culture where the media is exchanged slowly overtime to contain different concentrations of the inducers and antibiotics used for selection. Alternately, non-continuous cultures can be used where the bacteria are subjected to iterative cycles of induction and selection.</p>"},{"location":"project/plasmid_selection/#directed-evolution-of-is621-using-ecorep","title":"Directed Evolution of IS621 using EcORep","text":"<p>We attempted to apply our evolutionary logic in combination with EcoRep. This system allows for an orthog- onally increased mutation rate on the target gene in vivo <sup>3</sup>. Since we were unable to obtain the EcORep strain, we set out to engineer an adapted version of EcORep. Our goal was to create a system that carries all the genes necessary for stable replication of the O-Replicon on a single plasmid. The original system works as follows: A synthetic replication operon containing the PRD1 genes TP (pVIII), DNAP (pI), SSB (pXII) and DSB (pXIX) is integrated in the E. coli strain DH10B. The operon is under the control of the IPTG-responsive Ptac promoter. To establish the O-Replicon, the strain is first transformed with an additional \u201dhelper plasmid\u201d (pFR160GB) expressing SSB, DSB and Gam. The O-Replicon is then electroporated into this strain. The helper plasmid can then be cured from the strain. To expand and mutagenize the O-Replicon, the genomically integrated casette is repressed using a plasmid (pRT19) carrying dCas9 and gRNA targeted to the IPTG promoter. An additional plasmid expressing the PRD1 genes including a mutagenic version of DNAP (N71D), is expressed from another plasmid (pRT4-2). In our simplified design (pES084.2, 17), all genes necessary necessary for replication of the O-Replicon are carried on a low copy plasmid with the p15A ori. The TP and mutagenic DNAP-N71D are under the control of the PCymRC promoter optimized by Meyer et al.<sup>4</sup> This inducible promoter shows a great dynamic range and low leakiness. Expression in the induced state is 870 fold higher. Furthermore, we tried to optimize the expression levels of SSB, DSB, and Gam by creating a promoter and RBS library for each of the genes. This plasmid-borne system can easily be transformed. The reduced number of genetic components should also decrease the metabolic burden of carrying the system. Unfortunately, we have not been able to test our selection strategy with the EcoRep system within the time frame of our project. However, the selection logic is not directly linked to the method of gene diversification. Consequently, the system should work in combination with EcORep given that both systems have been shown to work independantly. The selection could also be employed in combination with any other DE method as long as selection takes place in vivo. Furthermore, the strategy requires only simple laboratory equipment.</p>"},{"location":"project/plasmid_selection/#references","title":"References","text":"<ol> <li> <p>A. A. Mengiste, J. L.
